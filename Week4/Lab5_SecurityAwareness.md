# Lab 5: Security Awareness & Social Engineering

## Objective
Identify and document common social engineering threats, explain how they work, and list best practices to mitigate them in an IT environment.

## Part 1: Common Social Engineering Threats

### Phishing
- **Definition:** Fraudulent emails or messages designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information or installing malware.
- **Example:** Fake "password reset" email from a look-alike domain.
- **Mitigation:** Verify sender address, avoid clicking unknown links, use spam filters.

### Spear Phishing
- **Definition:** Targeted phishing aimed at a specific person or organization.
- **Example:** Email crafted with insider details to trick an executive into sending confidential data.
- **Mitigation:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA), security awareness training.

### Vishing
- **Definition:** Voice phishing via phone calls pretending to be tech support, banks, or IT.
- **Example:** Caller claims to be from "IT" requesting your network credentials.
- **Mitigation:** Verify caller identity, hang up and call back through official channels.

### Smishing
- **Definition:** SMS/text message phishing.
- **Example:** Text with a link to "track a package" leading to a fake login page.
- **Mitigation:** Don’t click unknown links in texts, use carrier spam-blocking.

### Tailgating
- **Definition:** Gaining physical access to a secure area by following someone with authorized access.
- **Example:** Attacker walks in behind an employee without badging in.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce badge-in policy, challenge unknown individuals.

### Shoulder Surfing
- **Definition:** Observing someone’s screen or keyboard to steal information.
- **Example:** Watching a user type a password at a public terminal.
- **Mitigation:** Privacy screens, awareness of surroundings.

### Dumpster Diving
- **Definition:** Searching through discarded trash to find sensitive information.
- **Example:** Retrieving documents with customer info from a trash bin.
- **Mitigation:** Shred sensitive paper documents, wipe or destroy media before disposal.

## Part 2: Mitigation Strategies Summary
- Provide regular **security awareness training** to all employees.
- Use **MFA** to reduce damage from credential theft.
- Enforce **clear desk and screen lock policies**.
- Implement **secure disposal** for paper and digital media.
- Establish **incident reporting procedures** for suspected attacks.

## Summary
Social engineering attacks exploit human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities.  
IT professionals must stay alert, educate users, and enforce security policies to reduce risk.
