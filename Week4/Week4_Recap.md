- The code block is wrapped with triple backticks (` ```bash ` and ` ``` `) so you don‚Äôt forget!

## ‚úÖ Step 3.3: Create the Scaffolding Script

This is the **automated script** that copies your template and sets up folders for new labs.

### Run:

```bash
nano new-week.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Check if user passed a week name
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Please provide a week name (e.g., Week4)"
  exit 1
fi

# Set variable for the week
WEEK_NAME=$1

# Create folders
mkdir -p $WEEK_NAME/Screenshots

# Copy template Markdown to the new week folder and rename it
cp Templates/Lab_Template.md $WEEK_NAME/${WEEK_NAME}_Recap.md

# Confirm success
echo "‚úÖ Created scaffold for $WEEK_NAME:"
echo "- $WEEK_NAME/${WEEK_NAME}_Recap.md"
echo "- $WEEK_NAME/Screenshots/"
