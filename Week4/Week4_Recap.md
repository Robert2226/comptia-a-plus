## Objective
This week focused on deepening understanding of system-level security controls and malware prevention techniques on macOS, using both CLI and GUI tools. Emphasis was placed on user access control, password policies, and native anti-malware protections.

## Tools Used
- Terminal
- VS Code
- macOS

# Week 4 Recap – Security Labs Part 2

## Objective
This week focused on user access controls, password policies, malware protection, system monitoring, and security awareness in macOS and CLI environments.

## Labs Completed

### ✅ Lab 1: User Accounts & Permissions
- Used `id`, `groups`, and `dscl` to explore user and group metadata
- Compared CLI results to GUI in **System Settings > Users & Groups**
- Captured and stored GUI screenshot for documentation

### ✅ Lab 2: Password Policies & Expiration
- Tested `passwd` command in CLI and compared with GUI method
- Discussed common enterprise password policy rules
- Captured GUI screenshot for documentation

### ✅ Lab 3: macOS Anti-Malware
- Verified **Gatekeeper** status (`spctl --status`)
- Documented unsigned app behavior
- Investigated **XProtect** definitions and update history
- Checked **MRT** (Malware Removal Tool) history in system updates
- Reviewed common malware types and macOS defenses

### ✅ Lab 4: Security Tools Survey
- Used `top`, `ps aux`, and `lsof` to monitor processes and open files
- Checked network connections with `sudo lsof -i`
- Reviewed **Activity Monitor** GUI
- Captured Activity Monitor screenshot

### ✅ Lab 5: Security Awareness & Social Engineering
- Documented phishing, spear phishing, vishing, smishing, tailgating, shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving
- Listed mitigation strategies for each threat
- Summarized importance of user education and security policies

## Reflections
- Combining CLI and GUI approaches gives a fuller picture of system security
- macOS’s built-in security tools (Gatekeeper, XProtect, MRT) provide strong baseline protection
- Human factors remain a significant risk, making security awareness critical
